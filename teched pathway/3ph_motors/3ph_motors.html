    <h1>3 phase motors and you</h1>
        <p>
            when working with ac motors you should know how to read the motor plate. this can tell you how to wire the motor properly, and that you are using a suitable replacement. if you install the wrong motor your going to have a hard time claiming ignorance. its better to be competent enough to know for a fact what your doing.

        <p>
            being able to lookup a mounting hole profile by frame size has been useful to me. i had to make a template to drill 2 new holes and it helped tremendously to find the absolute dimensions for the mounting pattern. some NEMA frame motors can have a multi pattern mounting plate. if this was the original motor the mounting pattern that was drilled to mount may have been non standard. this poses a problem when you have to install a replacement motor that has NEMA standard pattern only.

        <p>
            understanding the reasons for the NEMA standard dimensions can help a tech trouble shoot if a motor is a proper replacement or not.
