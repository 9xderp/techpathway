    <h1>knowledge outline</h1>
        <p>
            in this i would like to outline basic knowledges and topics to be explained and expanded upon. i will   divide this into sections. these sections will be expanded on other separate pages. these pages will house the lists of external resources to learn from. i will save as many as i can to make this project as portable as possible.

    <h3>brazing</h3>
    <p>
        beyond the safety stuff there are important topics to know before your braze on a hvac system
    </p>
    <p>
        review cylinder safety here too. keep the bulk in the oxy acetyline area and reference to it
